*PhpStorm is a PHP IDE that actually ‘gets’ your code. It supports PHP 5.3/5.4/5.5/5.6/7.0/7.1/7.2, provides on-the-fly error prevention, best autocompletion & code refactoring, zero configuration debugging, and an extended HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editor.*

### Smart PHP Code Editor

The IDE provides smart code completion, syntax highlighting, extended code formatting configuration, on-the-fly error checking, code folding, supports language mixtures and more. Automated refactorings that treat your code with care, helping to make global project settings easily and safely.

### Code Quality Analysis

Hundreds of code inspections verify your code as you type and inspect the whole project for possible errors or code smells. Quick-fixes for most inspections make it easy to fix or improve the code instantly. Alt+Enter shows appropriate options for each inspection.

### Easy Code Navigation & Search

PhpStorm helps you get around your code more efficiently and save time when working with large projects. Jump to a method, function or variable **definition** in just one click, or search for its **usages**.

## Debugging, Testing and Profiling

*PhpStorm provides powerful built-in tools for debugging, testing and profiling your applications.*

### Debugging

Zero-configuration debugging makes it really easy to debug your PHP applications. Besides, PhpStorm provides numerous options for debugging your PHP code with Visual Debugger, so you can: inspect variables and user-defined watches, set breakpoints and evaluate an expression in runtime, debug remote applications, debug a page in multiple sessions simultaneously, and more.

### Testing

You can develop PHPUnit tests right in PhpStorm and run them instantly from a directory, file or class, by using the context menu options. Code Coverage from **PHPUnit** shows how much of your code is covered with tests.

### Profiling

You can profile your applications with Xdebug or Zend Debugger and check aggregated reports in PhpStorm.
